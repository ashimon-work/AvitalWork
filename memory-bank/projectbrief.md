# Project Brief: Online Business Promotion System

## 1. Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive Online Business Promotion System consisting of three interconnected web applications:

1.  **Storefront Website:** A customer-facing e-commerce site template for individual businesses to showcase and sell their products. Each business using the system will have its own instance of this storefront.
2.  **Store Management Website:** A secure, manager-facing portal for each business to manage their products, inventory, orders, customers, and store settings.
3.  **Global Marketplace Website:** An aggregator platform that displays products from all participating stores, providing broader visibility and cross-store discovery for customers.

## 2. Core Goals

*   Provide businesses with a customizable and functional online store presence.
*   Offer robust tools for store managers to efficiently run their online operations.
*   Create a central marketplace to increase product discoverability and drive traffic to individual stores.
*   Ensure a seamless and integrated experience across all three platforms.
*   Build a scalable and maintainable system using the specified technology stack.

## 3. Scope

The scope includes the design, development, and integration of the three websites as detailed in the "PAGE FUNCTIONALITY PLAN" document. This involves:

*   Frontend development for all user interfaces.
*   Backend development for APIs, data management, and business logic.
*   Database design and implementation.
*   Integration points between the three systems.
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Basic performance optimization and responsiveness.
